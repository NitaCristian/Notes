## Aims

- Introduce theoretical background and practical applications of NLP
- Connections with other fields 
- Analyze and discuss real-world problems

## Objectives

- Explain differences between rule-based and statistical approaches
- Select appropriate statistical language analysis techniques
- Use software tools such as corpus readers, stemmers, taggers and parsers
- Define formal grammars for fragments of a natural language
- Evaluate applications of statistical techniques

## NLP Perspectives

Computer/Data science
- Theoretical foundations of computation and practical techniques for implementation

Information science
- Analysis, classification, manipulation, retrieval and dissemination of information

Computational linguistics
- Use of computational techniques to study linguistic phenomena

Cognitive science 
- Study of human information processing (perception language, reasoning)

## NLP paradigms

Symbolic approaches:
- Rule-based, hand coded (by linguists, subject matter experts)
- Knowledge-intensive

Statistical approaches:
- Distributional & neural approaches, supervised or unsupervised
- Data-intensive

## NLP applications

- Text categorization

Media monitoring: classify incoming news stories and publish them to the right people

Search engines: classify query intent 

Spam detection

- Machine translation

Fully automatic: Google translate

Semi-automated: Helping human translators

- Text summarisation

Single-document / Multi-document
Search results
Word processing


- Dialog systems

Chat bots
Smart speakers
Smartphone assistants
Call handling systems

- Sentiment analysis

Identify and extract subjective information (opinions)

Sub-tasks:
- Identify polarity: positive, negative, neutral
- Identify emotional states: angry, sad, happy
- Subjectivity/objectivity identification
- Feature/aspect-based
	- Differentiate between specific features or aspects

- Text mining

Discover new knowledge from unstructured text resources

A<->B, B<->C
Infer A<->C
- link between migraine headaches and magnesium deficiency

- Question answering

Going beyond the document retrieval paradigm:
- provide specific answers to specific questions

- Natural language generation
- Speech recognition and synthesis

## History of NLP

Two foundational paradigms:
- the automaton
- information-theoretic models

The automaton arose out of Turing's model of algorithmic computation.

Chomsky considered finite state machines as a way to characterize a grammar.

Shannon borrowed the concept of entropy from thermodynamics:
- as a way of measuring information content of a language
- measured of the entropy of English by using probabilistic techniques
- measure of randomness

### Early NLP systems

ELIZA
- first chat bot
- pattern matching

SHDRLU
- natural language understanding
- comprehensive grammar of English
