Intelligent signal processing involves:
- capturing
- storing
- playing
- processing 
- extracting 
information from various signals found in the world using a computer system.

# Sound

## Physics

Sound:
- is a form of energy produced by vibrating matter
- is a mechanical energy that needs a medium to propagate
- can travel through solids, liquids, and gases in form of mechanical waves
- can't travel in a vacuum, in contrast to electromagnetic energy

## Psychology

Sound:
- is the reception of sound waves and their procession by the brain
- arrive through the ears
- is converted to nerve in impulses interpreted by the brain

## Characteristics

- Velocity 
- Wavelength
- Frequency
- Time period
- Amplitude

The vibration creates in the surrounding area a series of alternative: 
- high pressured regions --> compressions
- low pressure regions --> rarefactions
that travel away at a certain speed.

Sound waves:
- transfer energy but not matter
- can be represented as a function which ranges over particle density or pressure values across the domain of distance
- can also be represented as a function across the domain of time

Speed of sound depends on:
- the elasticity
- the density
- the temperature 
of the median the sound is traveling through.

Example:
- Air 0째C --> speed = 331 m/s
  Distance between a man and a bell is 33.1 meters, he will hear the bell in 100 ms
  Density changes with the temperature, greater density --> faster speed of sound
- Air 20째C --> less dense --> slower speed of sound
- Sea water 20째C --> 1540 m/s
- Steel 0째C --> 5960 m/s

Wavelength:
- the distance between two successive crests or troughs of a wave
- higher frequencies correspond to shorter wavelengths.

Amplitude:
- is the maximum change in pressure or density that the vibrating object produces

Pressure is measured in pascals.Although for practical reasons for maturing sound amplitude, we usually use a logarithm ratio scale, the dB SPL scale.

Frequency:
- is the number of times per second that a sound pressure waves repeats itself
- the repetitions are known as cycles
- measured in hertz or cycles per second

Time period:
- the duration of each cycle
- can be found by measuring the time between successive high or low pressure points
- period is the inverse of the frequency

The period (T) is the inverse of the frequency (f):
$$
T = \frac{1}{f} \quad f = \frac{1}{T}
$$
Example:

$$
T = 0.1s \quad f = \frac{1}{0.1s} = 10 Hz
$$

Direct relation between sound speed (v), wavelength ($\lambda$) and frequency (f):
$$
v = f \cdot \lambda
$$

$$
\lambda = 2m \quad v = 4 \frac{m}{s} \quad 4 = f \cdot 2 \quad f = \frac{4 \frac{m}{s}}{2m} = 2Hz
$$
## Human perception

Perceptual properties:
- pitch
- loudness
- timbre 

Pitch:
- classify sounds as higher or lower
- frequency relates to pitch.
- change in frequency does not always correspond to constant change in pitch

Loudness:
- order sounds on a scale from quiet to loud
- amplitude relates to loudness.

Timbre (tone quality):
- distinguish sounds which have same pitch and loudness
- waveform relates to  timbre.

All of the physical and perceptual properties relate to each other.

Pure tone
- sound that can be represented by a sinus function
- A pure tone is a sound with a sinusoidal waveform of any frequency, phase and amplitude. A pure tone is composed of a single frequency.

Perception of pitch
- high frequency corresponds to high pitch
- not linear correspondence

Humans can't hear all the sound waves. The range falls between 20 Hz and 20 000 Hz. 
Frequencies above 20 000 Hz are known as Ultrasound and below 20 Hz are known as Infrasound.

Perception of loudness
Sensation related to the amplitude of sound waves.

Sound Pressure in Pascals (SPL)

$$
SPL = 20 log_{10} (\frac{p}{p_{ref}})dB
$$
$p$ is the sound pressure, $p_{ref}$ is our reference
the smallest sound we can hear is $2.0 \cdot 10^{-5}Pa$

20 000 micro Pa in dB SPL
$$
20 log_{10} (\frac{20 000}{20}) = 20 log_{10} 1000 = 60
$$
